<p>Dr. Kolli offers psychiatric medication management and therapy services for children, adolescents, and adults. Although Dr. Kolli is highly knowledgeable about medication treatment for child, adolescent, and adult mental health conditions, she will always present all possible treatment options to her patients, including those that do not include the use of medications. When she prescribes medications, she attempts to use the lowest possible doses and least amount of medications possible. Dr. Kolli offers three main types of visits:<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Child and Adolescent Evaluation:</span>
The first step in receiving the right help for a mental health problem is receiving a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. A first visit consists of a face-to-face evaluation with Dr. Kolli. During this visit, she will assess your child or adolescent both individually and with you present. Please allow for 45-60 minutes for the initial appointment. If extra time is required, Dr. Kolli will request an additional one hour evaluation appointment.</p>

<p>During her comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, Dr. Kolli will take special care in gathering the right information to determine the most likely diagnosis and most effective treatment. For children, Dr. Kolli may ask parents’ permission to contact other significant people such as the family physician, school personnel, or other relatives to gather additional information. Dr. Kolli considers all aspects of one’s situation when determining the best treatment plan – including information about health, illness, and past treatment (medical and psychiatric); family health; information about child development; academic/work performance; friends and family relationships; and if necessary, laboratory studies such as blood tests, imaging studies, or special assessments (for example, psychological, educational, speech and language evaluations). She will work closely with patients and their family members from the very beginning to ensure that key problems have been identified and are adequately addressed.</p>

<p>At the end of this initial evaluation, the parent(s), child, and Dr. Kolli will make the determination whether or not to continue treatment with Dr. Kolli’s practice.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Adult Evaluation:</span>
A first visit consists of a face-to-face evaluation with Dr. Kolli. Please allow for 45-60 minutes for the initial appointment.  During this time, she will review your current issues as well as obtain information about your health, illness and past treatment (medical and psychiatric); family health; work performance; family and romantic relationships; and review any pertinent laboratory studies, records from previous providers, or special assessments.
At the end of this initial evaluation, you and Dr. Kolli will make the determination whether or not to continue treatment with Dr. Kolli’s practice.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Follow-up Appointments: </span>
Return visits with Dr. Kolli are in 20 minute time increments. The patient (or parent) may schedule for 20, 40, or 60 minute follow-up appointments depending on the complexity of the situation and the time needed. There is some non-clinical time (between 5-10 minutes) built into each appointment for completion of notes. The interval between visits can vary from one week to three months.</p>
