<p>Today’s medical climate and the reality of managed care has lead to many physicians being forced to have brief appointments with high patient volume. The emphasis has been more on efficiency and cost-savings, instead of high-quality, comprehensive, and personal care. Therefore, at this time, Dr. Kolli is considered “out-of-network” and does not participate in any private insurance plans, Medicare or Medicaid.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, you may submit a claim to your insurance company and may get as much as 80% reimbursed to you directly. This model has allowed Dr.Kolli to provide the highest quality of care without the imposed restrictions of insurance companies.</p>

<p>Upon request, Dr. Kolli will provide monthly statements with all the necessary information that you can submit to your insurance company for partial reimbursement. Most insurance companies require information about you/ your child’s diagnosis, the type of service provided, the date of the session, and fees.  Dr. Kolli will include this information on your statement.  You have a choice about whether to release medical information requested by an insurance carrier, but if you refuse to have information released, most insurance programs will not reimburse for services. Some people prefer to maintain complete privacy and therefore not involve their insurance company.</p>

<p>Payment is requested at the time of scheduling of each session and easy on-line payment is available through this website. By inputting the credit card information you are authorizing payment but the money will not be transferred until 48hrs prior to the appointment. Not showing for the scheduled appointment or canceling less than 48hrs will result in the full fee being charged to the credit card.</p>
