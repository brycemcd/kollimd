  Dr. Kolli is a child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist.</span></p>

<p>She is a licensed physician and board certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. If you or a member of your family is experiencing anxiety, sadness, problems with behavior or having difficulty in school, work, or relationships, Dr. Kolli may be able to help.</p>

<p>In her practice, Dr. Kolli spends time getting to know her patients and families. Dr. Kolli is a firm believer in early prevention. She understands that everyone’s situation is unique and makes every effort to understand all aspects of her patient’s life in order to reach an accurate diagnosis and deliver highly personalized treatment that maximizes chances of success.</p>

<p>Dr. Kolli believes her role is not only as a physician, but also an educator. Once an accurate diagnosis has been reached, Dr. Kolli spends time to explain the diagnosis and all treatment options to her patients. She believes in making her patients and families educated consumers of healthcare and working with them to make the best treatment decision for them.</p>

<p>Dr. Kolli feels that psychiatry is best practiced with a collaborative approach.  She strives to create an open, non-judgmental environment where she, her patients, and their families can collaborate to create a comprehensive treatment plan.</p>

<p>Dr. Kolli understands that people have busy schedules and respects their time. She doesn’t want you to be placed on hold while trying to schedule an appointment or spend an hour in a waiting room filling out forms. Therefore, Dr. Kolli offers a fully integrated website where patients can schedule appointments, make payments, and fill out forms, any time of the day, from the convenience of their own home.  Patients  have access to their own eRecord at all times and can monitor their own improvement.</p>
