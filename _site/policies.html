<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evaluation</span><br />
Your first few sessions will involve an evaluation of you or your child’s needs. During that time, Dr. Kolli will be acting as a consultant to your family. By the end of the evaluation, Dr. Kolli will be able to offer you some first impressions of what your work will include and a treatment plan. If, at the end of the evaluation process, you and Dr. Kolli feel it is a good fit, and you would like to continue working with her, then you/your child will be an “established patient” and treatment will begin.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">48-Hour Cancellation Policy</span><br />
The scheduled appointment time is reserved specifically for you/your child and this is your time. Therefore, if you are unable to keep an appointment, please be sure to cancel at least 48 hours in advance or you will be charged Dr. Kolli’s usual fee for that session. Please be aware that insurance companies generally do not reimburse for a cancelled session.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Arrivals</span><br />
Patients are seen by appointment. If you arrive late, the appointment must end as scheduled and you will be charged for the full amount of your scheduled visit. This will allow me to see each patient when they are scheduled.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prescriptions</span><br />
Dr. Kolli’s policy is to only write and refill prescriptions for psychotropic medications when you/your child is seen in person at a scheduled appointment. In the unusual case that a prescription is lost/stolen, or in emergency cases Dr. Kolli may authorize medication refills by phone to your pharmacy, but generally she prefers to see her patients for regular (at least monthly) appointments. If you need a prescription called in before your next regular appointment, please give Dr.Kolli at least a week to process your request. This will prevent any interruption in your medication use.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Phone Calls</span><br />
If you need to reach Dr. Kolli between appointments, please call (732) 655-4568 and leave a message with your telephone number, even if you think she may have it. Phone consultations lasting over 5 minutes are subject to a fee based on her hourly fee. Please consider scheduling an appointment if a longer conversation is necessary.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">E-mail Correspondence</span><br />
You are welcome to send non-urgent information to Dr. Kolli by e-mail, but she cannot guarantee the confidentiality or security of e-mail correspondence.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Urgent or Emergency Issues</span><br />
Dr. Kolli will do her best to respond to phone calls as soon as possible; however, she does not provide urgent, crisis or emergency services. In the event of an urgent need outside of an appointment, please contact the local emergency room, crisis intervention services, or call 911.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Confidentiality</span><br />
Information shared between patient and provider is strictly confidential, with certain exceptions required by law. You hold the privilege of deciding with whom Dr. Kolli may disclose information about evaluation and treatment. If you would like for Dr. Kolli to share information with other providers, therapists, school officials, or other persons, please fill out an Authorization for Release of Information for each person/entity with whom you would like me to communicate.</p>

<p>Dr. Kolli may occasionally find it helpful to consult another health professional about a case. During a consultation, she will make every effort to avoid revealing the identity of her patients. The other professionals are also legally bound to keep the information confidential. If you don’t object, they will not tell you about these consultations unless they feel that it is important to your work together.</p>

<p>Dr. Kolli will release information only with your written permission with the following exceptions:</p>

<p>1) suspected abuse or neglect of a minor, elder or dependent individual;<br />
2) a patient is in imminent danger of harming him or herself or another person;<br />
3) a patient communicates a serious threat of physical violence against another person;<br />
4) a parent or guardian is unable to adequately provide for a child’s basic needs;<br />
5) records are ordered to be released by a judge or court; and/or<br />
6) as otherwise required by law.</p>
