<p>Once you schedule your first appointment with Dr. Kolli, you will receive an email with information containing your unique user name and password.</p>
<p>Please log on to you/your child&#8217;s eRecord and fill out the initial forms. Dr. Kolli hand picks the forms that are most suitable to her patients and their presenting symptoms. She requests that the forms be filled out prior to meeting so she has an opportunity to review them before the appointment.</p>
<p>Periodically, Dr. Kolli will request patients or parents to fill out symptom checklists in order to monitor treatment effectiveness. Upon permission from the patient, behavioral health evaluation forms can also be sent to teachers, therapists, doctors, family members, and significant others through the eRecord. The person providing the collateral information would only have access to the form they are filling out and the remaining record would be kept confidential.</p>
<p>You have access to your eRecord at any time and can keep track of your own progress by reviewing past symptom checklists. You can also print out monthly bills with the diagnosis code to submit to insurance companies for partial reimbursement.</p>
